                <p>Hello, I'm Ryan. My goal is to get into the video game development industry. Ever since I was a kid, video games have always been a great way to relax and unwind, or explore a different world. I would love to help create games to help bring that joy to others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                I worked as a technical writer for about 5 years, writing SOPs and other large documents that required a lot of in-depth detail for training purposes and legal compliance. I've also worked as an auto mechanic for several years and I'm currently employed as a property manager/building maintenance technician. These career paths were very different from one another, but they created a unique foundation for learning to code. The detail-oriented work required for technical writing gave me a lot of experience following technical guidelines, in much the same way that I've had to follow along with coding projects in Codecademy and expect to see in the field. The troubleshooting and root cause analysis skills that I've learned as a mechanic and maintenance worker have also served me well, as I think of code as a mechanical system where different lines of code work as cogs in the overall machine.
                <br>
                <br>

                At home I enjoy creative work of all types including baking, woodworking, gardening and more. A big part of my decision to change careers is that for so many years I've worked jobs where I've had little opportunity to be creative. I also enjoy challenging myself and learning new skills. The main part of my current career that I enjoy is the puzzle-solving nature of troubleshooting and diagnosing malfunctioning equipment. I think a career in software and game development will be a good path for me as it satisfies the puzzle-solving type of work that I enjoy about my current job, with the added opportunity to develop new things and flex my creativity. Since computer technology is constantly evolving by necessity, it should always present an exciting challenge or opportunity to learn.
